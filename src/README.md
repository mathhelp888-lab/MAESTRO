# MAESTRO Threat Analyzer

The MAESTRO Threat Analyzer is an AI-powered tool designed to help developers and security professionals identify and mitigate potential threats in multi-agent systems. It uses Google's Gemini model and the MAESTRO threat modeling framework to analyze system architectures and generate detailed security insights.

This tool is built for educational and demonstrative purposes to showcase how threat modeling can be applied to complex, agentic AI systems.

## Reference

This tool is based on the **MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat, Risk, and Outcome)** framework for agentic AI threat modeling, as detailed in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) publication:

- **Paper**: [Agentic AI Threat Modeling Framework: MAESTRO](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/02/06/agentic-ai-threat-modeling-framework-maestro)

We highly recommend reading the paper to understand the seven-layer architecture and the principles behind this tool.

## Features

-   **Detailed Architecture Input**: Provides a textarea for users to describe their system architecture, which is used by the AI for analysis.
-   **Use-Case Presets**: Comes with pre-populated use-case descriptions that detail interactions between agents using protocols like **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.
-   **AI-Powered Threat Identification**: For each of the seven MAESTRO layers, the tool uses a Genkit flow to call the Gemini AI model. The AI identifies two categories of threats:
    1.  **Traditional Threats**: Inherent security risks for the layer's technology, independent of agentic factors.
    2.  **Agentic Threats**: Novel threats or exacerbations of existing ones arising from factors like Non-Determinism, Autonomy, and No Trust Boundary.
-   **AI-Driven Mitigation Generation**: For each identified threat, the AI recommends specific mitigation strategies, including the reasoning behind them and any potential caveats.
-   **Real-Time Analysis & Logging**: The UI streams the analysis progress in real-time, providing detailed logs as the AI works through each of the seven MAESTRO layers.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    -   Add your Google Gemini API key to the file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```

### Running the Application

This project requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Run the Next.js development server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the web application, typically available at `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Run the Genkit flows:**
    Open a second terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This command starts the Genkit development server and automatically reloads it when you make changes to your AI flows.

You can now open your browser and start using the MAESTRO Threat Analyzer.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to help improve the tool, please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
4.  Push your branch and open a pull request.

Please ensure your code follows the existing style and that you've tested your changes.

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. The threat analysis and mitigation strategies are generated by an AI model based on the MAESTRO methodology.

**AI can make mistakes.** The information provided by this tool should not be considered a complete or authoritative security audit.
